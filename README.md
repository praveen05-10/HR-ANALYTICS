# HR-ANALYTICS
Import the data into a DataFrame.
Check the first few rows to understand what the data looks like.
Check the data types and missing values using basic data information.
Identify missing values:
*Fill missing values (mean/median/mode) or
*Remove rows/columns with too many missing values.
Check for duplicate rows and remove them if found.
Analyze categorical columns (text-based data like "Gender", "Department").
List unique values in each categorical column to understand the categories.
Encode categorical variables (convert text to numbers).
Ensure all data is numerical and there are no missing values left.
Split the dataset into Features (X) and Target (y) variables.
